# Userchrome Toggle

The userchrome.css file lets you customize the Firefox interface deeply. While very powerfull, any changes will require a restart of the browser to take effect.

This [Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/userchrome-toggle/) adds a new button to your toolbar that allows you to toggle custom userchrome.css styling on-the fly. The magic happens by including special CSS selectors in your user styles. Manipulating those selectors allows you to enable/disable up to three of your modifications on-the-fly.

The addon accomplishes this by changing the browsers 'title prefix' attribute. Don't worry! By using invisible UTF-8 characters by default, you won't even notice a thing! Toggle a single style or select up to three styles to toggle in a drop-down menu. Hardcore keyboard users can even use customizable keyboard-shortcuts.
